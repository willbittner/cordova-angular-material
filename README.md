##Viewing with PhoneGap

To run the project on an iphone/iPad/android device, install phoneGap at http://phonegap.com. Then click the "+" button and choose "Add existing PhoneGap project". Choose the root directory as the project, then click the ">" button to create a server for the project. At the bottom of the PhoneGap program it will say "Server is running on: http://[name of server]". Next download the PhoneGap app from either the App Store or Play Store. Just enter this into the app and you should be able to view the project!

##Other

More info on Angular Material can be found on their [website](https://material.angularjs.org/#/). If you want to integrate Angular into the Cordova part of the application as well, I recommend using [ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com).

Enjoy!
